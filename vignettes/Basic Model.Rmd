# Basic Model

Here we reproduce the results for the standard BT model.

```{r}
library(TennisBT)
library(BradleyTerry2)
```

First we will get the training data.

```{r}
data <- TennisTidyr(2013,2022,2023,20)
train <- data$train
test <- data$test
players <- data$main_names
```

Now we can fit the BT model.

```{r}
btm <- BTm(outcome=1, factor(winner_name, levels=players), factor(loser_name, levels=players), 
                    formula=~player, id='player', data=train)
```

```{r}
summary(btm)
```

Finally we can predict the 2023 season and find the model scores.

```{r}
predictions <- predict_matches(test, players, btm)
head(predictions)
```

```{r}
score_predictions(predictions)
```
